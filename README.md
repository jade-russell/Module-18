# Module-18

For this assignment we were asked to use any of the Citi Bike Data we wished and create a visualtion through Tableau.

I chose to download all the data from the year 2024. This brought challenges, as it was just way too much data. 

I maxed out the cell limit in excel attempting to combine all the data into one sheet. This was because for some reason when I tried to upload the 12-month files separately, I was experiencing issues connecting the data together within tableau. This caused me to not include the entire December data. This potentially skewed some of the data. 

The most popular months to travel via bikes in 2024 were between October & December and June and July. 

The top start stations were in the Hoboken terminal and Grove St PATH witch also mirror the most popular end stations. The least popular stations seem to be in the 1 Ave and 3 Ave area. 

The Average Trip Distance shows a right skewed histogram shape. Peaking at .5 miles distance with a max of 3.4 miles
